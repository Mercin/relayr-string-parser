# Martina Terlevic code challenge assignment

It took me around 1 hour to complete the assignment. Most issues I had was with configuring the IDE, not with the code itself.

Testing framework used is JUnit5.
IDE used is IntelliJ.

### Run instructions
We can run this program in two different ways:

1. Using the command line, by positioning inside the main folder and running
    javac Main.java to compile the project
    javac Main.java arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 ...
    where the first argument is the string we wanna compare to the data sample, and every other argument is part of the data sample array
2. Through Intellij configure the Run options by adding Program Arguments.
